# 1. Basic For Loop (Iterating Over a List)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# 2. Using range() (Looping with Index)
for i in range(5):  # Loops from 0 to 4
    print(i)

# With custom start and step
for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # Loops from 1 to 9 with a step of 2
    print(i)

# 3. Looping with enumerate() (Index + Value)
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")

# 4. Iterating Over a Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}

# Loop through keys and values
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# 5. Iterating Over a String
for char in "Python":
    print(char)

# 6. List Comprehension (Concise For Loop)
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

# 7. Using zip() to Loop Over Multiple Lists
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]

for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")

# 8. Reversed Loop (Using reversed())
for num in reversed(range(1, 6)):
    print(num)

# 9. Using break and continue
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break  # Exits the loop
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skips even numbers
    print(i)

# 10. Using else with For Loop
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed without break!")
